✅ STEP 1: Run These Commands on the Working rhel8.6-vsaravan-sshbaremetaliso

Please run the following commands inside the working VM:

uname -r
rpm -qa | grep kernel
cat /etc/fstab
blkid
[ -d /sys/firmware/efi ] && echo "UEFI" || echo "BIOS"
lsblk
df -h
lsinitrd /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img | wc -l
lsinitrd /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img > /tmp/initramfs-working.txt
cat /etc/dracut.conf
ls /etc/dracut.conf.d/
cat /etc/dracut.conf.d/* 2>/dev/null


This will show:

Boot mode

Kernel version

What drivers are in initramfs

If dracut.conf or standard scripts changed anything

If anything was stripped from initramfs

✅ STEP 2: Do the Same on the Cadence Standard (Failing) Image

Also run on the failing image (built with Cadence standardization script):

uname -r
rpm -qa | grep kernel
cat /etc/fstab
blkid
[ -d /sys/firmware/efi ] && echo "UEFI" || echo "BIOS"
lsblk
df -h
lsinitrd /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img | wc -l
lsinitrd /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img > /tmp/initramfs-failing.txt
cat /etc/dracut.conf
ls /etc/dracut.conf.d/
cat /etc/dracut.conf.d/* 2>/dev/null

✅ STEP 3: Compare the Two

You can now either:

diff both initramfs-*.txt and dracut.conf files

Share the outputs here for me to compare

You’re specifically checking for:

Differences in included drivers

hostonly=yes in dracut.conf (which limits initramfs to current VM hardware)

Anything omitted in the Cadence Standard image
