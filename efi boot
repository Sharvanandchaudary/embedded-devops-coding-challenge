Got it ‚Äî your end goal is very clear now:

‚úÖ You want a RHEL‚ÄØ8.6 image that will boot on your bare‚Äëmetal server (which is currently UEFI‚Äëonly).
‚ùå Your current RHEL‚ÄØ8.6 VM image was built for BIOS mode and is not booting on baremetal.

üëâ To make it work for baremetal, you need to build or convert your image so it has UEFI support.

Below I‚Äôm giving you two options with step‚Äëby‚Äëstep details.
Please read carefully and choose which path you want to follow.

‚úÖ Option 1 (Recommended): Build a Clean UEFI Image
This is the safest and most supportable.

Create a new VM with UEFI firmware enabled:

In your virtualization platform (KVM/VirtualBox/VMware), enable UEFI/OVMF in firmware settings.

Attach the rhel-8.6-x86_64-dvd.iso installer.

Install RHEL‚ÄØ8.6 with proper partitions:

Custom partitioning:

Mount	Size	FS
/boot/efi	600‚ÄØMB	vfat
/boot	1‚ÄØGB	xfs
swap	2‚ÄØGB	swap
/	rest	xfs

Minimal install + cloud-init package.

Inside VM after install:

bash
Copy
Edit
dnf install -y cloud-init
systemctl enable cloud-init cloud-config cloud-final
cloud-init clean --logs
rm -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*
truncate -s 0 /etc/machine-id
Shutdown VM and export disk:

bash
Copy
Edit
qemu-img convert -O qcow2 /var/lib/libvirt/images/<diskname>.qcow2 rhel86-uefi.qcow2
Upload to OpenStack Glance:

bash
Copy
Edit
openstack image create \
  --container-format bare \
  --disk-format qcow2 \
  --public \
  --file rhel86-uefi.qcow2 \
  rhel8.6-baremetal
Deploy to baremetal using this image.

‚úÖ This will boot on baremetal because it was built in UEFI mode with a proper EFI partition.

‚úÖ Option 2: Convert your existing VM image (Advanced, Risky)
If you want to try converting your existing running 8.6 VM to UEFI mode instead of reinstalling:

Add an EFI partition:

Either shrink your root or add a second small disk (600‚ÄØMB):

bash
Copy
Edit
parted /dev/sda
mkpart EFI fat32 1MiB 601MiB
set 1 boot on
set 1 esp on
mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1
mkdir /boot/efi
mount /dev/sda1 /boot/efi
(Adjust device name accordingly.)

Install UEFI packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
dnf install -y grub2-efi-x64 shim-x64 efibootmgr
Reinstall GRUB for UEFI:

bash
Copy
Edit
grub2-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=RHEL
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg
Update fstab:

bash
Copy
Edit
blkid /dev/sda1   # get UUID
vi /etc/fstab
# Add line:
UUID=<efi-uuid>  /boot/efi  vfat  defaults,uid=0,gid=0,umask=077,shortname=winnt 0 2
Clean up like before (cloud-init clean, machine-id reset), shutdown, export qcow2, and upload to Glance.

Deploy to baremetal and test.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If your current disk is already fully allocated and you can‚Äôt add an EFI partition, conversion won‚Äôt be possible. That‚Äôs why building fresh is better.

üö¶ Why your current image doesn‚Äôt boot
It was installed in BIOS/legacy mode (no /boot/efi, no EFI bootloader).

Your baremetal firmware is configured for UEFI only.

So the server never finds a valid bootloader.

‚ú® Final recommendation
üëâ The clean rebuild in UEFI mode (Option 1) is the fastest, cleanest way to guarantee it will boot on baremetal.

‚úÖ If you want help with Option 1
I can:

Give you a ready Kickstart file to automate the install,

Or guide you step-by-step with screenshots.

‚úÖ If you want help with Option 2
I can:

Provide exact partitioning commands,

Walk you through GRUB installation.
