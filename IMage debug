Perfect — since both images are already running in separate VMs (working image VM and Cadence image VM), you can run comparison commands live inside each VM instead of mounting .img files.

Here’s a complete command-by-command checklist to run inside each VM and compare outputs across the two.

✅ Target: Find why Cadence VM fails with dracut error while standard RHEL 8.6 works

Let’s call:

VM1 = WORKING (Red Hat base image)

VM2 = FAILING (Cadence release image)

🔍 Step-by-Step Debugging & Comparison Commands
1. 🧠 Kernel Version
uname -r
rpm -qa | grep kernel


✅ Confirm both are using compatible and similar kernel versions.

2. 📦 Check initramfs file for missing modules
lsinitrd /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img | less


Check that the failing VM has essential modules like:

xfs, ext4, ahci, nvme, dracut-initqueue, udev, sd_mod, ata_piix, etc.

If missing, rebuild using:

dracut -f -v --add-drivers "xfs ext4 ahci sd_mod"

3. 🗃️ fstab vs blkid
cat /etc/fstab
blkid


Ensure UUID in fstab exists in blkid

Common dracut error: boot fails when wrong or missing UUID used in fstab

4. 🔧 Check GRUB Configuration
cat /boot/grub2/grub.cfg | grep -A10 menuentry


Compare:

linuxefi line: kernel path

initrdefi: initramfs path

root= should match UUID= from blkid

5. 🧰 Installed dracut config
cat /etc/dracut.conf
cat /etc/dracut.conf.d/*


Cadence image may have stripped modules via omit_drivers+=... or hostonly=yes

6. 🔒 SELinux status
getenforce


If SELinux is Enforcing, but labels are incorrect (due to rsync or packer), it can break boot. Run:

fixfiles -F relabel

7. 🧪 Bootloader device target
grub2-install --version
lsblk
df -h


Check if GRUB was installed on the right boot device and EFI partition is properly mounted (/boot/efi).

8. 🧱 Compare installed packages (optional)

Export and diff package lists:

On each VM:
rpm -qa | sort > /tmp/pkglist.txt


Then copy both files to one VM:

scp user@vm2:/tmp/pkglist.txt /tmp/pkglist_vm2.txt
diff /tmp/pkglist_vm1.txt /tmp/pkglist_vm2.txt | less

9. 🔁 Check if both have network, lvm, multipath modules (if used)
lsinitrd | grep lvm
lsinitrd | grep net
lsinitrd | grep multipath


If any of those were used in provisioning (like provisioning over PXE or using volume groups), missing support in initramfs will cause boot to fail.

10. 🧹 Rebuild initramfs (on failing Cadence image)

If you see differences or missing modules:

dracut -f -v --add-drivers "xfs ext4 ahci nvme sd_mod ata_piix" --kver $(uname -r)


You can also disable hostonly:

dracut -f -v --no-hostonly


Then reboot and verify.

🧠 Bonus: Capture Boot Logs (If Available)

If the Cadence VM boots partially:

journalctl -xb


Or reboot with debug kernel params in GRUB:

linuxefi ... rd.debug console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200


It will give detailed dracut logs at boot.

🔚 Final Advice

Once you compare:

Feature	Working VM	Cadence VM (Failing)	Notes
Kernel version	✅	?	Should match or be compatible
Initramfs mods	✅ Includes all	❌ Missing drivers?	Check lsinitrd
fstab/UUID	✅ Correct	❌ Wrong/missing	Common boot issue
GRUB cfg	✅ Valid entries	❌ Broken/missing	root=UUID must exist
dracut conf	✅ Basic config	❌ hostonly=true?	Avoid stripping too much
SELinux	✅ Permissive	❌ Enforcing?	Re-label with fixfiles
Boot logs	Available	Dracut fail logs	Use rd.debug

Let me know if you want a script to automate this comparison between two VMs over SSH or diff result collation.

You said:
 ok will give you all outputs check

Perfect — once you share the outputs from both the working and failing (Cadence) VMs, I’ll:

Compare them side by side

Highlight what’s different (e.g., kernel, initramfs modules, GRUB, fstab)

Suggest precise fixes (e.g., rebuild initramfs with specific drivers, adjust grub, fix UUIDs)

You can share outputs in chunks, such as:

uname -r

lsinitrd /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img

cat /etc/fstab

blkid

cat /boot/grub2/grub.cfg | grep -A10 menuentry

cat /etc/dracut.conf and ls /etc/dracut.conf.d/

getenforce

Any relevant logs: journalctl -xb or rd.debug output if available

I'll wait for your first set of outputs.






✅ Step-by-Step: Check for Required Drivers in initramfs

Run the following command inside the failing VM:

lsinitrd /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img | grep -E 'xfs|ext4|nvme|ahci|ata_piix|sd_mod|dracut-initqueue|udev|multipath|lvm'


This will search for:

Driver/Module	Why it's important
xfs, ext4	File system support (for / or /boot)
nvme, ahci	NVMe/SATA disk controllers
ata_piix, sd_mod	Legacy disk/IDE/SCSI support
dracut-initqueue	Handles boot waiting for devices
udev	Handles device creation
multipath	For multipath boot configs (if used)
lvm	For Logical Volume Manager boot root
🧪 Optional: Save full list to compare later

If you want to keep the full list:

lsinitrd /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img > /tmp/initramfs-cadence.txt


Then do the same on the working VM:

lsinitrd /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img > /tmp/initramfs-working.txt


And then diff:

diff /tmp/initramfs-working.txt /tmp/initramfs-cadence.txt | less


Let me know once you run that first grep command. I’ll analyze the output for missing modules.

ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check important info.
