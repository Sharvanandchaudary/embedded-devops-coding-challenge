Baremetal RHEL 8.6 – Cadence Standard Production Image
Goal

Validate and deliver a Cadence-standard RHEL 8.6 image that can reliably boot on baremetal systems, ensuring readiness for production deployment.

Activities

Tested Cadence BMR and PXE images on RHEL 8.6.

Debugged baremetal boot failures (nodes remained in power-off state).

Compared vanilla RHEL 8.6 ISO vs Cadence images.

Modified ISO builds and validated SSH/cloud-init access.

Partnered with Imaging team to convert ISO into a Cadence-standard image.

Work Done

Cadence BMR & PXE Failures

RHEL 8.6 Cadence BMR and PXE images consistently failed to boot baremetal.

Some failed even in Dev environment, leaving nodes powered-off.

UEFI vs Legacy BIOS

Identified that Cadence PXE image lacked an EFI partition (baremetal requires UEFI).

Adding EFI partition did not resolve the boot issue.

ISO Approach

Used RHEL 8.6 vanilla ISO, which successfully booted baremetal.

Default cloud-user login required modifications in sshd_config and cloud.cfg.

Created new image from modified ISO volume and promoted step-by-step (Dev → Test → Baremetal).

Cadence Standardization

Shared working 8.6 ISO image with Imaging team.

Their automation converted it into Cadence-standard format.

Issues identified:

Kernel update broke boot functionality.

GRUB contained a hardcoded UUID, causing mismatch.

Resolved by ensuring no kernel update during imaging.

Final Outcome

Delivered a RHEL 8.6 Cadence-standard baremetal image that boots successfully.

Validated SSH access and confirmed promotion workflow.

Image is production-ready.

Due Diligence

Verified across Dev, Test, and Baremetal environments.

Root causes identified and documented: missing EFI partition, kernel updates during imaging, GRUB UUID misconfiguration.

Established repeatable methodology for future baremetal image builds.

Acknowledgements

Thanks to Bala and Abhishek for their diligence and support during debugging and validation.
