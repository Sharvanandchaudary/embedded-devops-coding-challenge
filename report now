 Goals for the Day
1.	Work on the provisioning approach for large-memory VMs in Cadence Cloud (CLOUD3-1375).
2.	Analyze and begin resolving the hardcoded password issue in awoouto3 script within the usersync module (CLOUD3-533).
3.	Investigate Noida ODC backup issue and plan a solution walkthrough (CLOUD3-1306).
 Work Done
1. CLOUD3-1375 – Provisioning Large Memory VMs (Cadence Cloud)
•	Focused on designing the approach for deploying large-memory virtual machines in Cadence Cloud.
•	Analyzed existing flavor definitions and server-to-resource mappings required for high-memory workloads.
•	Explored the use of host aggregates and affinity/anti-affinity policies in OpenStack to ensure correct placement on memory-intensive hosts.
•	Worked with the infrastructure team to understand availability zones and aggregate metadata configuration.
•	Investigated how scheduler hints can be leveraged to target specific host groups during deployment.
•	Documented the provisioning strategy for repeatable use, aligned with Cadence requirements, without initiating the actual deployment.

2. CLOUD3-533 – Password Hardcoded in awoouto3 (Usersync Script)
•	Reviewed the usersync script awoouto3 and identified instances of hardcoded passwords.
•	Analyzed security risks and maintainability issues due to embedded credentials.
•	Proposed a secure solution involving externalizing passwords using environment variables or a secure secret management approach.
•	Work is currently blocked pending access to the system where the script is deployed, which is required to test and validate the proposed solution.
•	Raised a request for necessary access and coordinated with the team to move forward on implementation.

3. CLOUD3-1306 – Noida ODC Backup Issue
•	Analyzed the existing backup setup for the Noida ODC environment, including reviewing cron jobs, script execution flow, and backup target paths.
•	Identified possible causes of failure such as misconfigured job timings, incorrect script references, and inconsistent retention handling.
•	Documented the findings and prepared a proposed solution to streamline and stabilize the backup process.
•	Scheduled a call with Sourav for tomorrow to present the analysis and walk through the recommended remediation steps.
•	Compiling action items and changes into a solution document to align during the discussion.
