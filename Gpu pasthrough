Day 1 - Goal and Work Done

Goals:

Provisioned a new OpenStack VM instance with GPU passthrough enabled using two H100 GPUs to support compute-heavy tasks.

Defined and applied a custom OpenStack flavor with the correct passthrough alias configuration for H100 GPUs.

Launched the VM with the expected CPU, memory, and PCI device configurations to match project requirements.

Verified successful GPU passthrough by checking GPU hardware presence using the lspci command.

Ensured remote access capability to the VM by configuring floating IP and testing SSH connection.

Encountered and investigated DNS resolution issues inside the VM which were blocking internet access.

Checked kernel version compatibility with the targeted NVIDIA driver for H100.

Downloaded the correct NVIDIA .run driver file externally due to internet restrictions in the VM environment.

Used SCP to securely transfer the downloaded .run file to the test VM for offline installation.

Prepared all prerequisites inside the VM for offline NVIDIA driver installation to be completed next day.

Work Done:

Created and applied the OpenStack flavor g2-h100x2-32xlarge with passthrough alias h100-sxm:2.

Verified presence of both H100 GPUs in the VM by executing lspci and confirming the PCI device list.

Faced initial issues in accessing the VM via SSH due to DNS failure and network restrictions.

Diagnosed the cause of DNS issues and confirmed no internet resolution was working from inside the VM.

Downloaded the required NVIDIA driver .run package on a local development machine.

Used SCP to upload the .run driver file into the VM over the configured floating IP connection.

Adjusted OpenStack security groups to allow SSH access from trusted sources.

Successfully established SSH session to the target VM with the uploaded keypair.

Checked hardware readiness and kernel prerequisites before driver installation.

Confirmed all components were ready to proceed with offline NVIDIA driver installation in Day 2.

Day 2 - Goal and Work Done

Goals:

Install the NVIDIA driver in a fully offline mode on the RHEL 8.6-based test VM to enable GPU workloads.

Validate that both attached H100 GPUs are accessi
